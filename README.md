## 🛠 Features Implemented in MatrixAPI

* **Top Menu Entry:** `MatrixAPI` inserted at Option 0 of the main game menu.
* **Inspect Player Target:** Remote programmatic player inspection via J2ME text input box (`main.a.L`).
* **Packet 93 Dispatch:** Remote lookup by character name string (`dq.a().a(name, 0)`).
* **Console Logging Engine:** Logs all 18 profile stats (**Level, Class, School, HP, MP, Speed, Attack, Resistances, Dodge, Critical, Counter Stats, Chakra**) directly to the terminal console without log flooding.
